John Z. Li's little programming corner. 

* Sometimes, when I learn a thing or two about programming and I like to write it down, I also put it here in case I might forget in the future 
 (They are not meant to serve as tutorials for learning programming). 
* Sometimes, when I feel an urge to rant about a programming language, a programming tool, or anything related with programming, 
 I tend to write down what I have in mind at the time (They are just personal, possibly biased opinions).
* Sometimes, I talk about programming problems arising in specific scientific/engineering domains (possibly numerical methods, computer aided control system design or robotics).
